## CIA World Factbook Data Analysis with SQL

In this project, I analyse the CIA's World Factbook data using SQL and Python. The analysis is fairly basic, running SQL queries with pandas' read_sql_query method. To analyse the data, I use aggregation functions, conditionals, and subqueries. I also make use of the DataFrames produced with the aforementioned pandas method to visualize some results in histograms.
